definitions
preemption threshold --> some number representing the sequence length which will trigger preemption
running state --> which sequences will go thru an inference iteration on the next step
waiting state --> sequences which have yet to been processed at all
preempted running state --> sequences who have met the preemption threshold and have been moved out of the running state
preempted waiting state --> sequences who have met the preemption threshold 
inference mode --> normal or preempted

Schedule function:
1. Get rid of everything that is past preemption threshold
2. Fill in the empty spots
3. Which mode?

if inference mode is normal:
    (1) for sequence in running state:
            if sequence >= preemption threshold:
                move sequence to preemption waiting state

    (2) for sequence in waiting state:
            if space in running state:
                move sequence to running state

    (3) if preempted waiting state + swap is >= X or running/waiting are empty:
            set inference mode to preempted

if inference mode is preempted: --> 
    (4) for sequence in preempted waiting state:
            if space in preempted running state:
                move sequence to preempted running state
     (5) if preempted waiting state + swap is <= Y or waiting is not empty:
            set inference mode to normal

return control LLM engine which then runs inference step
